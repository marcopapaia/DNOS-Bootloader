-- To Create a Disk Image --

- Create a disk image
- Partition it with fdisk (or manually)
- Replace the MBR if disired (should not be necessary)
- Format a parition to EXT2
- Write the stage 1 boot sector (necessary if custom MBR is not used)
- Write stage 2 to sectors 1 - 62 inclusive
- Mount the partition (loop devices work well on linux)
- Create a file named 'DNOSIC.CFG'
- Copy the compiled x86 output file, it must be named 'dnos_kernel.elf'
- Unmount the disk
- DNOS should run in qemu and bochs
